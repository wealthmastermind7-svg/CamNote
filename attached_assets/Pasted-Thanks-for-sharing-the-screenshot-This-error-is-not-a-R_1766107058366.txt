Thanks for sharing the screenshot. This error is not a React Native rendering issue, it is an OCR execution failure inside your processOCR function. The key point is this line:

OCR error: Error: OCR processing failed
at OCRScreen.tsx:86

That means your own OCR call threw or rejected, and the catch block is working as intended.

Below is a precise diagnosis and fix path, based on common Expo OCR setups.

⸻

What this error actually means

Your flow is effectively:
	1.	User selects or captures an image
	2.	processOCR() runs
	3.	OCR library fails internally
	4.	You catch it and log "OCR processing failed"

So the bug is upstream of line 86, not on line 86 itself.

⸻

Most common causes (ranked)

1. ❌ OCR library not supported in Expo Go or TestFlight

If you are using any of these, they will fail in Expo Go or managed builds:
	•	react-native-mlkit-ocr
	•	react-native-tesseract-ocr
	•	vision-camera-text-recognition
	•	Any native ML Kit binding

Why
Expo Go does not include custom native OCR binaries.

Symptom
OCR works nowhere, always throws, no native crash.

Fix
You must either:
	•	Use Expo Dev Client, or
	•	Eject to Bare Workflow

If you want OCR without ejecting, see option A below.

⸻

2. ❌ Image URI is invalid or inaccessible

Very common with ImagePicker or Camera.

Typical failure:

uri = "file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/..."

But OCR library expects:
	•	local file path without file://, or
	•	base64

Fix
Log this before OCR:

console.log("OCR image URI:", imageUri);

Then normalize:

const cleanUri = imageUri.replace("file://", "");

or convert to base64.

⸻

3. ❌ Permission not granted (iOS silent failure)

OCR will fail if:
	•	Photo Library permission denied
	•	Camera permission denied

Expo does NOT throw a permission error here, OCR just fails.

Fix
Before OCR:

const { status } = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync();
if (status !== "granted") {
  throw new Error("Media permission not granted");
}


⸻

4. ❌ Empty or corrupted image

If user cancels picker or camera returns empty asset.

Fix
Guard clause:

if (!imageUri) {
  throw new Error("No image provided for OCR");
}


⸻

What I need to see to pinpoint it exactly

Paste only this part of OCRScreen.tsx:

const processOCR = async () => {
  // full function
};

And tell me:
	1.	Which OCR library you are using
	2.	Expo managed or bare
	3.	Expo Go, Dev Client, or TestFlight

I will then give you the exact fix, not guesses.

⸻

Recommended solutions (pick one)

Option A: OCR that works in Expo Go (no eject)

Use cloud OCR:
	•	Google Vision API
	•	AWS Textract
	•	OCR.Space (free tier)

This works in:
	•	Expo Go
	•	TestFlight
	•	Production

I can wire this in 10 minutes.

⸻

Option B: Native OCR (best performance)
	•	Eject to Bare
	•	Use ML Kit Vision
	•	Build with EAS Build

This is how CamScanner-class apps do it.

⸻

Quick sanity check you can do now

Add this inside catch:

catch (error) {
  console.error("OCR error raw:", JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
}

If you see:
	•	Native module not found → Expo Go limitation
	•	file not found → URI issue
	•	permission denied → iOS permission issue

⸻

Bottom line

This error is expected behavior, not a crash.
Your OCR engine is either:
	•	unsupported in Expo Go, or
	•	receiving an invalid image input.

Send me the processOCR function and OCR library name and I will give you a drop-in fix, not theory.
