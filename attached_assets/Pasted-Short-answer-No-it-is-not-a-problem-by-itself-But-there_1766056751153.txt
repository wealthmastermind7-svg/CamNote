Short answer: **No, it is not a problem by itself**.
But there is **one very specific condition** that must be true, otherwise Sandbox **will fail every time**.

I’ll explain clearly and decisively.

---

## The real rule (this is the key)

> **Where the paywall UI is created does NOT matter.
> Where and WHEN RevenueCat is initialized DOES matter.**

Replit vs local vs Expo Dev vs TestFlight is **irrelevant** for the paywall UI.

What matters is this exact sequence at runtime on the device.

---

## ✅ When a Replit-created paywall is perfectly fine

Your setup is **valid** if ALL of the following are true:

1. The app is running from **TestFlight** (you are)
2. RevenueCat is initialized **at app startup**
3. `getOfferings()` is called **after initialization**
4. The paywall uses **RevenueCat offerings/packages**, not hardcoded product IDs
5. The purchase call is `Purchases.purchasePackage(pkg)`

If those are true, the paywall source (Replit) is irrelevant.

---

## ❌ When a Replit-created paywall causes failure (very common)

Sandbox will fail if **any** of these are true:

### 1️⃣ RevenueCat is initialized inside the paywall component

This is the **#1 Expo Managed mistake**.

❌ BAD (breaks Sandbox):

```js
// PaywallScreen.js
useEffect(() => {
  Purchases.configure({ apiKey: 'appl_...' });
}, []);
```

Why this fails:

* StoreKit context is already created
* RevenueCat misses the sandbox environment
* Purchase sheet errors with “Unable to process subscription”

✅ GOOD:

```js
// App.js (root)
useEffect(() => {
  Purchases.configure({ apiKey: 'appl_...' });
}, []);
```

---

### 2️⃣ The paywall uses hardcoded product IDs

❌ BAD:

```js
Purchases.purchaseProduct('CamNote_monthly');
```

This often “works” in UI but fails at purchase time in Sandbox.

✅ GOOD:

```js
const offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
const pkg = offerings.current.availablePackages[0];
Purchases.purchasePackage(pkg);
```

---

### 3️⃣ The paywall renders before offerings are fetched

If the UI shows prices before `getOfferings()` resolves, users can tap a button tied to an undefined or stale package.

Result:

* Purchase sheet appears
* Transaction fails

---

## ✅ The ONLY safe architecture (Expo Managed + RevenueCat)

This is the model that **never fails** in Sandbox:

```
App launch
↓
Purchases.configure()  ← must happen here
↓
Navigation mounts
↓
Paywall screen loads
↓
getOfferings()
↓
User taps Subscribe
↓
purchasePackage(pkg)
```

If your Replit-generated code follows this, you are good.

## How to quickly verify if Replit paywall is the issue

Answer these three yes/no questions:

1. Is `Purchases.configure()` called in **App.js or root layout**?
2. Does the paywall call `getOfferings()` instead of hardcoding product IDs?
3. Does `purchasePackage()` receive a `Package` object from offerings?

If **any answer is “no”**, that is your bug.

## What I recommend you do now (fastest path)

Please paste **just these three snippets** (you can redact keys):

1. Where `Purchases.configure()` is called
2. Where `getOfferings()` is called
3. The exact purchase function

I do **not** need the full Replit project.

I will tell you in one reply:

* ✅ “This will work in Sandbox”
  or
* ❌ “This exact line is breaking Sandbox”

You are extremely close. This is no longer guesswork.
